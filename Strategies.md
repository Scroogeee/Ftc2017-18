# Strategies
On this page you'll find a detailed description of our goals and strategies.
### Autonomous
In the 30 second autonomous period, we can kick off the jewel from the plattform, place a glyph in one of the columns with gyroscope assistance and park in the safe zone. We are planning to scan the VuMarks and finding the right column with a range sensor.
(see the [autonomous](/../../tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/autonomous) package for more details)
### Driver Controlled
In the driver controlled period, we place as many glyphs into the cryptobox as possible, controlling 2 glyphs at a time. We are also able to park on the balancing stone and in theory also of placing the relic upright into the third recovery zone, but currently our extending arm for the relic is broken.
