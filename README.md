## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot,
used by our Team F.R.O.G. for the 2017/18 "Relic recovery" season.

As the season has passed, it is now considered archived.

See https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc for more information about the competition.
